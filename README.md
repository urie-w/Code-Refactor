# Code-Refactor

## Description

The motivation for this project was revising the original code, so that it was more user friendly. Previously all the elements where span or divs. i revisied them to symatic elements to create a more user friendly code. Some problems that I ran into where repeating lines on code for multiple elements. This wasn't the most effective way so instead I made all reapeating code into one class.
